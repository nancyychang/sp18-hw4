## Questions

1. What is the difference between `new` and `create` for a model?
'create' saves the record into the database.

2. What command followed after with `Cat.new` will emulate the same behavior as `Cat.create`?
'Cat.save'

3. What is the default integer column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?
Record ID

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "Kira" in the database?
Cat.create({name: "kira"})

5. How did you like this homework in comparison with the previous homeworks?
It was a bit more involved, so I probably should have started it earlier than the day before it was due. I'm turning this in a day late, but after finishing it I feel like this homework was pretty informative and tied together everything we learned so far pretty well. I could use more practice, but that's something to do on my own time.
